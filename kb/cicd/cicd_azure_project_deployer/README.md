# CI/CD pipeline sample with Jenkins

This is the code for an Azure pipeline to build a full CI/CD sample flow. The Azure pipeline definition itself is in the azure-pipelines.yml file.

This is sample is leveraging [Project Deployer](https://doc.dataiku.com/dss/latest/deployment/deploying-bundles.html) which is a feature available only since version 9. See the sample without Project Deployer if you have an older version.

You can find the explanations and how-to related to this sample in https://knowledge.dataiku.com/latest/kb/o16n/ci-cd/azure-project-deployer.html
