# Dataiku DSS CI/CD pipeline sample with Jenkins

This is the code for a Jenkins pipeline to build a full CI/CD sample flow. The project can be cloned within the pipeline using a single command 
```
git credentialsId: "git_hub_ssh", url: "git@github.com:XYZ/dss_pipeline.git"
```

The pipeline sample itself is in the pipeline.groovy file
