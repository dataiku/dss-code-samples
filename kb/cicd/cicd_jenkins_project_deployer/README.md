This is the code for a Jenkins pipeline to build a full CI/CD sample flow. The Jenkins pipeline definition itself is in the pipeline.groovy file

This is sample is leveraging [Project Deployer](https://doc.dataiku.com/dss/latest/deployment/deploying-bundles.html) which is a feature available only since version 9. See the sample without Project Deployer if you have an older version.
