# CI/CD pipeline sample with Jenkins

This is the code for a Jenkins pipeline to build a full CI/CD sample flow. The Jenkins pipeline definition itself is in the pipeline.groovy file

This sample is using direct upload to Automation node. If you have a version higher than 9, we strongly suggest to leverage [Project Deployer](https://doc.dataiku.com/dss/latest/deployment/deploying-bundles.html).
If so, please look for the other sample using project deployer (the APIs used are different)

You can find the explanations and how-to related to this sample in https://knowledge.dataiku.com/latest/kb/o16n/ci-cd/jenkins-pipeline.html
